# Coin Grabber Game

Welcome to **Coin Grabber Game**! This project was created as part of my **Computer Graphics** class during my second year of college. The game is built using **Python** with the help of the **Pygame** and **random** modules.

## üéÆ About the Game
Coin Grabber is a simple, fun, and engaging game where the objective is to collect as many coins as possible while navigating the game environment. It demonstrates core computer graphics concepts, such as rendering, animations, and event handling, implemented using the Pygame library.

## üöÄ Features
- **Dynamic gameplay:** Coins appear randomly on the screen.
- **Interactive experience:** Move your player and grab coins to increase your score.
- **Smooth graphics:** Built with Pygame for a seamless gaming experience.
- **Randomized elements:** Positions of the coins are determined using the `random` module, making each playthrough unique.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Modules:** 
  - [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) (for graphics and game mechanics)
  - [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) (for randomization of coin positions)
